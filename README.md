# Aram Stat Collector
A simple program that pulls ARAM stats from the Riot API for the given summoner name.
This will require a Riot Games API key to use (anyone can get one by simply going to https://developer.riotgames.com/)

Instructions to run:
1. Install Python
2. Run 'pip install riotwatcher'
3. Navigate to the directory you saved the file and run 'python aram.py'

There is no error handling/validation as this is just a quick/fun project I did so if you enter invalid info it will just error and crash.
